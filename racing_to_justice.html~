Renowned social justice advocate john a. powell persuasively argues that we have not achieved a post-racial society and that there is much work to do to redeem the American promise of inclusive democracy. Culled from a decade of writing about social justice and spirituality, these meditations on race, identity, and social policy provide an outline for laying claim to our shared humanity and a way toward healing ourselves and securing our future. Racing to Justice challenges us to replace attitudes and institutions that promote and perpetuate social suffering with those that foster relationships and a way of being that transcends disconnection and separation. <br />

Quotes and thoughts while reading: <br />

'[f]or Europeans, freedom is found not in autonomy but in embeddedness. To be free is to have access to many interdependent relationships. The more communities one has access to, the more options one has for living a full and meaningfull life. <strong>It is <em>inclusivity</em> that brings security - belonging, not belongings."</strong> (p XVIII) A good way to start this jouney through the book is to think about this quote. The beauty and implicity of the statement that what we should crave is beloning, not belongings. I love it. I also didn't pick up the first time that this is the dominant cultural narrative of Europeans, andd that maybe that is truly what we are lacking in thie country. That someday we may align with this mindset. <br />
<br />
"Aristotle, who gave us much of our understanding of equality, asserted that it is just to treat those who are situated similarly the same, but it would be unjust to treat those who are situated differently the same."(p 10) Isn't this the basis to the colorblind theory? That we should treat everyone the same? But the problem lay in the fact that they haven't considered the second part to Aristotles quote - that we aren't all situtated similarly yet. <br />
<br />
Page 15 brings up this beautiful point, and makes clear this idea of affirmative action for whites. In the 40's and 50's the GI bill, along with a myriad of other social programs served as a type of affirmative action for white men returning from war. They were given loans with low interest rates, free college education, "in fact, no other single instrument did as much to widen the racial gap in postwar America."(p 14) The language, and the weight behind the words affirmative action, causes this to stick out to me. I hadn't thought of framing it in this way, but it really was just that - affirmative action targeted at a group of people. <br />
<br />
Targeted Universalism is this huge idea that needs a lot of time and space. It needs to be allowed to fill the buckets of people's mind and overflow a bit. Instead of "universal" policies, that attempt to raise all boats, without really looking into the quality of the boats that people are manning - targeted univeralism first looks to the boat, and ensures that everyone is sea-worthy. And if you aren't targeted universalism pays special attention to getting your vessel ready to sail. Then, you can start applying a more universal approach. But it would be remiss to forget to first analyze the needs of both the dominant and marginalized parties. "Targeted univeralism rejects a blanket approach that is likely to be indifferent to the reality that different groups are situated differenlty relative to the institutions and resources of soceity. It also rejects the claim of formal equality that would, as a way of denying different, treat all people the same. Any proposal would be evaluated by the outcome as well as the intent.(p 14) <br />
<br />
I am embarassed to admit that before this book I didn't really know what <em>Plessy V. Ferguson</em> was about(I hope I retain it too). I'd heard of it, but I hadn't realized it was the fulcrom that confirmed that the notion of "seperate but equal" was constitutional. <br />
<br />
Ooh, maybe this will make me sound like an elitist, but the notion of "the common man" laws made my blood boil.
