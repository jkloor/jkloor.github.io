Breasts

When I was 12 I would peek ay my mother and sister's Victoria's Secret catalogues.But unlike most boys my age instead of admiring the shapely bosoms of the models, I was learning the types and names on those glossy pages. Racerback, demi cup, Angels Collection, Tonga bathing suits, front clasp, push up, full coverage. All these shaped, held, and supported the breasts I so desperately wanted to have hanging from my chest. I dreamed of the day I would get to lean forward, nestle my breasts into the satin cups, clip the catch around my back, and stand up with my chest outthrust proudly.

The first time I wore a bra I snuck it out of my sister'sâ€™ drawer. A simple blue training bra with adjustable straps, it hung loosely on my chest, yet tight in wrong places. Socks were such a waste to fill the cups. No bounce. No movement. No weight. They were a very distant facsimile to the bust I craved; but under a shirt they brought eroticism and blush to my cheeks.

As I have grown older, they still surround me, a vestige which has yet to adorn my chest. With sexual partners I longingly embrace their areola tipped mounds, wanting to feel what they feel, saliva tipped peaks, wishing my breasts reflected theirs. Always surprised at how adept I am at releasing the clasp to their bra, the thought that I have released my own clasp is outside their cognitive reach. So few have I told my secret desires, the most unnerving were those who guessed.
