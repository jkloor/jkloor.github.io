<p align="left">An ancient title of respect for women, the word &ldquo;cunt&rdquo; long ago veered   off this noble path. Inga Muscio traces the road from honor to   expletive, giving women the motivation and tools to claim &ldquo;cunt&rdquo; as a   positive and powerful force in their lives. In this fully revised   edition, she explores, with candidness and humor, such traditional   feminist issues as birth control, sexuality, jealousy between women, and   prostitution with a fresh attitude for a new generation of women.   Sending out a call for every woman to be the Cuntlovin&rsquo; Ruler of Her   Sexual Universe, Muscio stands convention on its head by embracing all   things cunt-related. This edition is fully revised with updated   resources, a new foreword from sexual pioneer Betty Dodson, and a new   afterword by the author. &ldquo;Bright, sharp, empowering, long-lasting,   useful, sexy....&rdquo;—San Francisco Chronicle &ldquo;... Cunt provides fertile   ground for psychological growth.&rdquo;—San Francisco Bay Guardian &ldquo;Cunt does   for feminism what smoothies did for high-fiber diets—it reinvents the   oft-indigestible into something sweet and delicious.&rdquo;—Bust Magazine
