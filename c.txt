Piercing dark brows sit nestled atop caring eyes;
dancing above painted eyelids
they welcome others.

Beautifully they dominate my attention,
time seems to stand still,
caught between your lashes.

With red lips,
your smile pushes
frowns towards the edge
of upturned corners.

Fortified dams,
holding back years of history,
become dismantled and free flowing.

Where sorrow drifts,
so does happiness, 
cascading into eddies
we wade in and out of.

Gliding above the river that is our life,
we remember the rapids that thrilled,
and those that terrified.

And looking ahead, 
we know,
the river keeps flowing,
and more rocks lay in our path.

But, with piercing dark brows sitting nestled atop caring eyes;
dancing above painted eyelids
others are welcomed.
