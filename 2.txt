Complexity takes shape under knowing hands.
With a quick glance and whiff,
the sourdough starter is confirmed.
Alive and active she waits to feast!

Carefully she is fed, and moved,
mingled and mixed with delicious flour,
salt and sugar.

Her world has grown,
so much abundance.
The knowing hands timidly await the feasting mother.

Flicking switches, turning dials,
the final resting place is prepared.

Tumultuous, ground shaking, movement!
Topsy turvy world spinning motions,
plunk, the bloated mother rests in a new home. 

Another time of peace,
but the knowing hands must interrupt once more.
Handles grabbed,
the pan slid into that sacred place.
A watch is checked and a sigh breathed.

Magic happens in that sacred place,
New creatures materialize and die,
a whole ecosystem created for a lifetime.

Prometheus brings this heat and transformation.

Mitt covered knowing hands grasp this world,
ceasing the magic.

Hours pass, smells emanate,
warming hearts and aching stomachs.

Again, knowing hands gently share this world,
bringing smiles and content.
