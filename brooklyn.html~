“One of the most unforgettable characters in contemporary literature” (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette), 
Eilis Lacey has come of age in small-town Ireland in the hard years following World War Two. 
When an Irish priest from Brooklyn offers to sponsor Eilis in America, she decides she must go, 
leaving her fragile mother and her charismatic sister behind. <br />
<br />
Eilis finds work in a department store on Fulton Street, and when she least expects it, finds love. 
Tony, who loves the Dodgers and his big Italian family, slowly wins her over with patient charm. 
But just as Eilis begins to fall in love, devastating news from Ireland threatens the promise of her future. <br />
<br />
Quotes and thoughts while reading: <br />
<br />
There is a pooping scene on p 44, that I just have to mention, because it created this air of reality around
Eilis. It was so funny, and real, and goodness just made me laugh. <br />
<br />
I really enjoyed, how when Eilis was homesick, she was taken care of. She was understood, and those around
her were so nice to her. They didn't say "buck up", or "get your shit together", they talked to her, gave her time
and space, and offered to help her. I have to remember to be more understanding of people. When they are
in a time of need, I should try to help them, not judge them. (p 81) <br />
<br />
Culture clashes abound: "There were no vegetables or potatoes accompanying it,... this was normal for Italians..."(p 155)
It's fun to hear this perspective, and to imagine this scene. A young Irish girl, looking for the potatoes, but instead
being greeted with this delicious Italian meal, surrounded by an Italian family. <br />
<br />
There was this weird bathing suit scene on p 161, which never got resolved. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to pull
from this scene. Other input would be nice, on what I am supposed to think. Was it creepy, endearing, motherly, sweet? 
I just don't know. <br />
<br />
Oh, you know, Rose. We can truly feel bad about what happened to her, I think. <br />
<br />
"She thought that he was going to cry; she felt almost guilty that she had handed some of her grief to him, and then
she felt close to him for his willingness to take it and hold it, in all its rawness, all its dark confusion." (p 192) <br />
<br />
And then there is a not so fun sex scene. Not fun. <br />
<br />
The book was recommended by a young woman who spoke of how much she was impressed by Toibins ability to
capture a female voice, and to put it to paper in a convincing way. I am curious if I missed it because I am not a young
woman, who recently moved away from the East Coast into a seemingly foreign land. I smile knowing that someone
could feel like a transplant to a new community, much in the same way Eilis did, and to have a book that they can
identify with. Eilis is a strong woman, and a very lovable character,  and I am glad that I had the 
opportunity to read it. And I am thankful for the recommendation, even though the person who did will never know
that I read it.
