Frozen Melting Thoughts

Thoughts swimming in murky depths,
Blurred visions refracted below.
Some listlessly traveling,
Others zipping by.
Ripples form on the surface,
as thoughts jump into view.

Finger tips dance a melody on your skin,
keys press down as harmonies vibrate.
The piano of your body,
a muse to compose music.

Wind chime laughter,
gusts push smiles through,
a mirror image grin greets you.

Words on paper,
a window into myself,
exploring new lands,
untraveled, unfound.
