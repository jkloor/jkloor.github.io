February 8th 2009

It rained in El Cajon,
it never rains in El Cajon.

In the most fitting way one can attend a funeral,
with black umbrella in hand,
I stepped into St. Kierens church.

And at the cemetary,
for the first time in years,
there was worry of soggy ground,
for the body to be buried in.

It rained in El Cajon that day,
it never rains in El Cajon.
