1944

The round headlights 
of the 1938 ford 
dimly lit the road.
on the third day of October in 1944.

Fred and Ethel Kloor,
and soon to be William,
careened and slolomed through the streets of Massachuesets.
Headed to the hospital,
the unknown and alien pain,
of a first born.

He arrived, 
their first of three, 
which came from the intermingling
in the sheets of my grandparents.

Could they guess,
the life their boy would lead?
As they stared down into his
hazel flecked eyes,
his hair topped head,
surely they imagined a whole world for him.

And as the round headlights,
to the 1938 Ford dimly lit their way home,
Fred and Ethel prepared for their first day,
as parents.

And William prepared for his first day, 
as a son.
