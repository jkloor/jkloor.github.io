Tonight I had an experience. I went to a mindfulness meditation class, and
after we had seated outselves and begun the process of breathing, of
beginning to look inward, and to be mindful of our place and time, I
began to feel my body change. I was seated corss-legged, my hand face down
on my knees / thighs. And as I sat, and breathed, my thighs seem to get larger,
my hands smaller, my torso did not exist anymore. The hands were no longer
attached to my shoulders, and the space between my legs, feet, and knees
was not the same size as my torso. I could feel all of this.

My hands, my hands on those large knees, were as if I had climbed the 
lincoln statue on the national mall and were pressing my hands to his
knees. 

It was as if my head were simply looking down upon this scene,
it was not attached to the hands, or the knees, nor the non-existent 
torso. I'm not sure if it means anything, but for a while, I had completely
disambiguated myself from my body.
