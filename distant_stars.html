DISTANT STARS is a curious re-collection of Delany short stories. It's perhaps notable most for including the story "Omegahelm", which is unavailable elsewhere but interesting in that it is uses the same narrative setting as Delany's well-known novel STARS IN MY POCKET LIKE GRAINS OF SAND. Most of Delany's best-known and award-winning stories are here, alongside several previously-uncollected lesser efforts. The volume also includes some ambitious, if not always entirely successful, illustrations to accompany the tales. In any case, probably a must for Delany devotees, and it's a shame the collection is out of print.
