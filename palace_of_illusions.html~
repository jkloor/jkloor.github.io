<p align="left">
In her new collection, gifted poet and novelist Kim Addonizio uses her literary powers to bring to life a variety
 of settings, all connected through the suggestion that things in the known world are not what they seem. <br />
 <br />
In “Beautiful Lady of the Snow,” young Annabelle turns to a host of family pets to combat the alienation she feels
 caught between her distracted mother and ailing grandfather; in “Night Owls,” a young college student’s crush on her
  acting partner is complicated by the bloodlust of being half-vampire; in “Cancer Poems,” a dying woman turns to a 
  poetry workshop to make sense of her terminal diagnosis and final days; in “Intuition,” a young girl’s sexual 
  forays bring her closer to her best friend’s father; and in the collection’s title story, a photographer looks 
  back to his youth spent as a young illusionist under the big tent and his obsessive affair with the carnival owner’s wife. <br />
<br />
The stories in this collection have appeared in journals ranging from Narrative Magazine to The Fairy Tale Review, and 
include the much loved "Ever After," which was featured on NPR's "Selected Shorts." <br />
<br />
Distracted parents, first love, the twin forces of alienation and isolation: the characters in The Palace 
of Illusions all must contend with these challenges, trafficking in the fault lines between the real and the 
imaginary, often in a world not of their making.
