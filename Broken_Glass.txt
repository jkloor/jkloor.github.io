Broken Glass

Pieces lie
with jagged edges.

A hint at the shape once formed
by their cohesive bonds.

Fingers nudge and perturb
the clear sharp bits.

Sighs breathed
options weighed.

An image of the solid piece
begins to take shape.

Jigsawed and puzzled over,
each ragged piece nestled with it's pair.

Parts lost forever,
reminders of the place and time.

But the essence of what it was,
restored.
