<p align="left"><em>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus </em>is   the essential tool for couples who want to develop more satisfying   relationships with their partners. John Gray provides a practical and   proven way for men and women to communicate better by understanding and   respecting the differences between them.
<p align="left"> When it comes to relationships, most   would agree that it's a cosntant battle of the sexes. Pretending that   men and women are from different planets can help us to deal with the   opposite sex in a loving and accepting way, leading ot better   relationships.<br />
  <br />
  Throughout <strong>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus,</strong> John   shows how to diminish frustration and disappointment in relationships,   and instead create intimacy and relate lovingly to the opposite sex,   through a better understanding and accepting the differences between men   and women.<br />
  <br />
  John explains what it takes to have a successful relationship. He   provides different scenarios from both the woman's and the man's point   of view and offers advice on how to counteract differences in   communication styles, emotional needs, and behavior patterns. <br />
  <br />
  John realizes that &quot;not only do men and women communicate differently,   but they think, feel, perceive, react, respond, love, need, and   appreciate differently.&quot; So, instead of discussing &quot;why&quot; men and women   are different, he focuses on what those differences are and explains the   ways men and women react to stress, what motivates them, and their   emotional cycles and needs.</p>
