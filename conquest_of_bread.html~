The Conquest of Bread is Peter Kropotkin's most detailed description of the ideal society, embodying 
anarchist communism, and of the social revolution that was to achieve it. Marshall Shatz's introduction 
to this edition traces Kropotkin's evolution as an anarchist, from his origins in the Russian aristocracy 
to his disillusionment with the Russian Revolution. The volume also includes a number of his shorter writings, 
including a hitherto untranslated chapter from his classic Memoirs of a Revolutionist. <br />

Quotes and thoughts while reading: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Millions of human beings have laboured to create this civilization on which we pride ourselves today. Other
millions, scattered through the globe, labour to maintain it. Without them nothing would be left in 50 years
but ruins. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There is not even a thought, or an invention, which is not common property, born of the past and present. 
Thousands of inventors, known and unknown, who have dies in poverty, have co-operated in the invention of each of these machines
which embody the genius of man. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thousands of writers, of poets, of scholars, have laboured to increase knowledge, to dissipate error, and to create
that atmosphere of scientific thought, without which the marvels of our century would never have appeared. And these thousands
of philosophers, of poets, of scholars, of inventors, have themselves been supported by the labour of past centuries. They have
been upheld and nourished through life, both physically and mentally, by legions of workers and craftsmen of all sorts. They
have drawn their motive force from the environment." (p 15) <br />
<br />
"The 'right to well-being' means the possibility of living like human beings, and of bringing up children to be members of a 
society better than ours, whilst the 'right to work' only means the right to be always a wage-slave, a drudge, ruled over and 
exploited by the middle class of the future. The right to well-being is the social revolution, the right to work means nothing 
but the treadmill of commercialism. It is high time for the worker to assert his right to the common inheritance, and to enter
possession of it. " (p 30) Hmm, doesn't this sound familiar, like something one might read in a book titled "This Changes Everything"?
But this was written at the turn of the 20th century, why didn't it come true? <br />
<br />
"As long as there is no fear of the supply running short, no water company thinks of checking the consumption of water in each house. 
Take what you please! But during the great droughts, if there is any fear of the supply failiing, the water companies know that all 
they have to do is make known the fact, by means of a short advertisement in the papers, and the citizens will reduce their 
consumption of water and not let it run to waste." (p 62) Wishful thinking, from a different time I am afraid. <br />
<br />
"Since our middle-class civilization is based on the exploitation of inferior races and countries with less advanced industrial
systems, the revolution will confer a boon at the very outset, by menacing that 'civilization', and allowing the so-called inferior
races to free themselves." (p 72) <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;"[A] house was not built by its owner. It was erected, decorated and furnished by innumerable workers - in the timber yard, the 
brick-field and the workshop, toiling for dear life at a minimum wage. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The money spent by the owner was not the product of his own toil. It was amassed, like all other riches, by paying the 
workers two-thirds or only a half of what was their due. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover - and it is here that the enormity of the whole proceeding becomes most glaring - the house owes its actual value
to the profit which the owner can make out of it. Now, this profit results from the fact that his house is built in a town - that is, in 
an agglomeration of thousands of other houses, possessing paved streets, bridges, quays and fine public buildings, well lighted, and
affording to its inhabitants a thousand comforts and conveniences unknown in villages; a town in regular communication with other towns,
and itself a centre of industry, commerce, science and art; a town which the work of twenty or thirty generations has made habitable,
healthy and beautiful." (p 75) <br />
<br />
"Imagine a society, comprising a few million inhabitants, engaged in agriculture and a great variety of industriesâ€”Paris, 
for example, with the Department of Seine-et-Oise. Suppose that in this society all children learn to work with their hands 
as well as with their brains. Admit that all adults, save women, engaged in the education of their children, bind themselves 
to work 5 hours a day from the age of twenty or twenty-two to forty-five or fifty, and that they follow occupations they 
have chosen in any one branch of human work considered necessary. Such a society could in return guarantee well-being to 
all its members; that is to say, a more substantial well-being than that enjoyed to-day by the middle classes. And, 
moreover, each worker belonging to this society would have at his disposal at least 5 hours a day which he could 
devote to science, art, and individual needs which do not come under the category of necessities, but will probably 
do so later on, when man's productivity will have augmented, and those objects will no longer appear luxurious or inaccessible." (p 92)
Hmm, sounds a lot like B F Skinner proposes in Walden Two. And here I was thinking he had some new idea. Nope, just a reiteration of 
Kropotkin. Still, it does make a lot of sense, and if you want to know more, read the whole chapter titled "Ways and means". <br />
<br />
The world Kropotkin imagines on p 99 and 100, I believe was alive during the first decade or so of the internet. Now, things have
become monetized again, but there was this hayday of anarchism that really felt right about the net. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; "'The works of each!' But human society would not exist for more than two consecutive generations if everyone did not
give infinitely more than that for which he is paid in coin, in 'cheques', or in civic rewards. The race would soon become extinct
if mothers did not sacrifice their lives to take care of their children, if men did not give continually, without demanding and 
equivalent reward, if men did not give most precisely when they expect no reward. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong> If middle-class society is decaying, if we have got into a blind alley from which we cannot emerge without
attacking past institutions with torch and hatchet, it is precisely because we have given too much to counting. It is because we
have let ourselves be influenced into <em>giving</em> only to <em>receive</em>. It is because we have aimed at turning society
into a commercial company based in <em>debit</em> and <em>credit</em>.</strong>" (p 155) How about them apples. Isn't that what's
wrong with the world today? Everything comes down to how will this help me? Not how can I help? <br />
<br />
Again, from p 196 "They will experiment..." we see more linkages between Walden Two and The Conquest of Bread. The whole agriculture
section in general is pretty interesting. The methods that Kropotkin wants to see put into use: greenhouses, building up soil, 
mechanization... have all been put into use. And while we certainly currently have the capacity to feed the world, there is still
the issue of distribution. <br />
<br />
"I read this books while I was still in Petersburg, where it appeared in 1972 in German Loatin's Translation. Even then I very much
disliked the pretentiousness of the book as well as its unscientific character - the theory of value, for example, is not demonstrated
scientificially but has to be taken on faith - and its indulgence in scientific jargon. Marx's excursions into the realm of numerical
expressions and algrebraic formulae were comical: they demonstrate his utter inability to think concretely, in quantitative terms, and
Nicholas Tsinger(an astronomer) and I had a good laugh over his 'formulae', which he sets out so pretentiously without even suspecting how
amusing they are to a mathematician accustomed to the idea of units of measurement. Highly comical as well is his penchant for expressing 
himself in formulae where formulae express nothing. In 1876, when I met German Lopatin in London, we spoke a bit about Marx's book, which
as its translator he knew thouroughly, and I remarked that Marx's theory as both old (it derives from Adam Smith) and untrue. In contemporary
society goods are not exchanged in proportion to the amount of socially necessary labour (as Adam Smith had already remarked); but to the 
extent that this is desireable in the future society - another question which Marx never even touches one - he was still more or less a 
communist. To my astonishment, Lopatin replied that the theory of value was not important. Marx's main task was to establish the historical 
origins of capital. But Lopatin was obviously expressing the opinion of their circle." (p 221) <br />
<br />
<strong>"...it was Kropotkin's aim to prove that communism at least partial - has more chances of being 
established than collectivism, especially in communes taking the lead, and that free, or anarchist-communism is the only form of communism 
that has any chance of being accepted in civilized societies; communism and anarchy are therefore two terms of evolution which complete each 
other, the one rendering the other possible and acceptable. He has tried, moreover, to indicate how, during a revolutionary period, a large 
city - if its inhabitants have accepted the idea could organize itself on the lines of free communism; the city guaranteeing to every inhabitant 
dwelling, food and clothing to an extent corresponding to the comfort now available to the middle classes only, in exchange for a half-day's, or 
five-hours' work; and how all those things which would be considered as luxuries might be obtained by everyone if he joins for the other half of 
the day all sorts of free associations pursuing all possible aims - educational, literary, scientific, artistic, sports and so on. In order to 
prove the first of these assertions he has analysed the possibilities of agriculture and industrial work, both being combined with brain work. 
And in order to elucidate the main factors of human evolution, he has analysed the part played in history by the popular constructive agencies of 
mutual aid and the historical role of the state." (p 245) <br /> </strong>
<br />
"Alongside science, there is a second element that lies at the foundation of Kropotkin's anarchism, and that is the humanistic.
What Kropotkin experienced among the Russian peasents, the Swiss watchmakers, and his own comrades in the revolutionary movement
was a moral community whose members instinctively recognized each other's fundamental human worth and dignity.... What
is most striking, and most moving, in his autobiography is its account of the growth of his moral consciousness. There was
nothing scientific or, indeed, 'natural' about the transformation of this Russian aristocrat, serf owner and page de chambre
to the tsar into the sworn enemy of an unjust social order. It was the result of a prolonged and hard-won intellectual
and moral struggle...." (p XIX)
