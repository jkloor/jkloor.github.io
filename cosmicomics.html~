Enchanting stories about the evolution of the universe, with characters that are fashioned from mathematical formulae and cellular structures. 
“Naturally, we were all there, - old Qfwfq said, - where else could we have been? Nobody knew then that there could be space. Or time either: 
what use did we have for time, packed in there like sardines?” <br />
<br />
Thoughts brought up while reading: <br />
<br />
Without an atmosphere everything on earth would be grey and bland! Imagine, the world we live in, but without color. Like the moon, entirely white-washed. <br />
<br />
The Distance of the Moon reminded me of the Pixar short La Luna. The characters were Italian, it must be a nod to Calvino. <br />
<br />
I love the idea of affixing a sign in space, that is somehow outside the universe, in that it is stable, but still observable. Earthlings should erect a 
sign that says "We were here, there are intelligent beings in the universe, just not when you are." Or something to that effect.
