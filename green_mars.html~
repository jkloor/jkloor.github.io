In the Nebula Award winning Red Mars, Kim Stanley Robinson began his critically acclaimed epic saga 
of the colonization of Mars, Now the Hugo Award winning Green Mars continues the thrilling and 
timeless tale of humanity's struggle to survive at its farthest frontier. <br />
<br />
Nearly a generation has passed since the first pioneers landed, but the transformation of Mars 
to an Earthlike planet has just begun The plan is opposed by those determined to preserve the 
planets hostile, barren beauty. Led by rebels like Peter Clayborne, these young people are the 
first generation of children born on Mars. They will be joined by original settlers Maya Toitovna, 
Simon Frasier, and Sax Russell. Against this cosmic backdrop, passions, rivalries, and friendships 
explode in a story as spectacular as the planet itself. <br />
<br />
Quotes and thoughts while reading: <br />
<br />
"She was convinced that all human history had gone wrong at the start. At the dawn of civilization, she
would say to me very seriously, there was Crete and Sumeria, and Crete had a peaceful trading culture, run
by women and filled with art and beauty--- a utopia in fact, where the men were acrobats who jumped bulls 
all day, and women all night, and got the women pregnant and worshiped them, and everyone was happy. While
Sumeria on the other hand was ruled by men, who invented war and conquered everything in sight and started 
all the slave empires that have come since. And no one knew, Hiroko said, what might have some happened
if these two civilizations had had a chance to contest the rule of the world, because a volcano blew Crete
to kingdom come, and the world passed into Sumeria's hands and has never left it to this day. If only that
volcano had been in Sumeria, she used to tell me, everything would be different." (p 35) <br />
<br />
"The desert side of the dike appeared to be some two hundred meters high... The dike was about three hundred meters wide at the top... 
"Aren't they going to have to replace that whole mound with concrete?" she said to Sax, who had joined her,
and was looking through his own binoculars at the sigh. <br />"Face it," he said... "Face the dike with a diamond
coating. That would last fairly long. Perhaps a few million years." (p 584) This is the perfect example of the abusrdity
present in this book. Since they have the capacity to build up any element they want from their respective elements, they
can plan to do ridiculous things like facing a 200m high cliff face with diamonds. This happens all over the book. <br />
<br />
Overall, it's a fun read, but just went on too long. I'm sure, in a bit, I'll read Blue Mars, but not anytime soon. The
Earth elements included in this book are expanded upon in Blue Mars, and while that might be interesting, I just cant spend 
another 600 or so pages in this world.
