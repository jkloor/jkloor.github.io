<p align="left">Why is the Atlantic slowly filling with crude petroleum, threatening a   millions-of-years-old ecological balance? Why did traders at prominent   banks take high-risk gambles with the money entrusted to them by   hundreds of thousands of clients around the world, expanding and   leveraging their investments to the point that failure led to a global   financial crisis that left millions of people jobless and hundreds of   cities economically devastated? Why would the world's most powerful   military spend ten years fighting an enemy that presents no direct   threat to secure resources for corporations?<br />
  The culprit in all cases   is neoliberal ideology—the belief in the supremacy of &quot;free&quot; markets to   drive and govern human affairs. And in the years since the initial   publication of Noam Chomsky's Profit Over People: Neoliberalism and   Global Order, the bitter vines of neoliberalism have only twisted   themselves further into the world economy, obliterating the public&rsquo;s   voice in public affairs and substituting the bottom line in place of   people&rsquo;s basic obligation to care for one another as ends in themselves.   In Profit Over People, Chomsky reveals the roots of the present crisis,   tracing the history of neoliberalism through an incisive analysis of   free trade agreements of the 1990s, the World Trade Organization, and   the International Monetary Fund—and describes the movements of   resistance to the increasing interference by the private sector in   global affairs.<br />
  In the years since the initial publication of Profit   Over People, the stakes have only risen. Now more than ever, Profit Over   People is one of the key texts explaining how the crisis facing us   operates—and how, through Chomsky&rsquo;s analysis of resistance, we may find   an escape from the closing net.</p>
