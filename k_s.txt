Dancing

When I see K and S dancing there is a swelling that happens in 
my heart. Not that my heart is normally contracted and diminished, but that
seeing the love they share, and the way they hold one another and smile
seems to offer the chance for my heart to burgeon with the sort
of limbic connection they have with each other.

There is a softness to their dancing, two souls that found their respective
halves, melting and melding into one another as their hands and feet move
in unison. They make brief eye-contact, in which worlds are created and
destroyed, as their focus wanes in and out of other realms. 

When others' are dancing around them the contrast is even more striking. 
Laughs and smiles are on the faces of everyone in the room, but the way
K and S smile at one another is more intimate, a more deep and knowing 
smile. Like they are smiling not at the dance they are doing now, but at
all the dances they have done and will do ad infinitum. Herky jerky motions
are present in the other dancers, but not with K and S. They are like
whipped cream, while everyone else is cheese curds.

I smile for them, and with them, a smile so large and deep my lips turn 
into small pink ribbons, and for a moment I see nothing but the world theyâ€™ve
created in their locked hands, unified motions, and captured gaze.

And so, when I see K and S dancing, my heart swells and I smile.
