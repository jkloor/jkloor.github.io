Dismal Dark Day

The rain came down like artillery bombarding the city

With Mother Nature we reign war.

Attempting to shield ourselves from her attack.

Umbrellas spring up like anti-aircraft missiles.

Roofs act like chaffing for the rain.

While drainage carries away the fallen soldiers of Mother Nature.

Safe in our concrete bunkers we wait out the barrage.

She only has so much ammo.

An ally approaches.

He attacks with photons.

Bursting their way through her formidably dark clouds.

Rays of salvation bathe the bunkers.

Mother Nature retreats to another day.
