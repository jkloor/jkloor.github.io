Renowned media scholar Sherry Turkle investigates how a flight from conversation undermines our relationships, creativity, and productivity—and why reclaiming face-to-face conversation can help us regain lost ground.<br />
<br />
We live in a technological universe in which we are always communicating. And yet we have sacrificed conversation for mere connection.<br />
<br /> 
Preeminent author and researcher Sherry Turkle has been studying digital culture for over thirty years. Long an enthusiast for its possibilities, here she investigates a troubling consequence: at work, at home, in politics, and in love, we find ways around conversation, tempted by the possibilities of a text or an email in which we don’t have to look, listen, or reveal ourselves.<br />
 <br />
We develop a taste for what mere connection offers. The dinner table falls silent as children compete with phones for their parents’ attention. Friends learn strategies to keep conversations going when only a few people are looking up from their phones. At work, we retreat to our screens although it is conversation at the water cooler that increases not only productivity but commitment to work. Online, we only want to share opinions that our followers will agree with – a politics that shies away from the real conflicts and solutions of the public square.<br />
 <br />
The case for conversation begins with the necessary conversations of solitude and self-reflection. They are endangered: these days, always connected, we see loneliness as a problem that technology should solve. Afraid of being alone, we rely on other people to give us a sense of ourselves, and our capacity for empathy and relationship suffers. We see the costs of the flight from conversation everywhere: conversation is the cornerstone for democracy and in business it is good for the bottom line. In the private sphere, it builds empathy, friendship, love, learning, and productivity.<br />
 <br />
But there is good news: we are resilient. Conversation cures.<br />
 <br />
Based on five years of research and interviews in homes, schools, and the workplace, Turkle argues that we have come to a better understanding of where our technology can and cannot take us and that the time is right to reclaim conversation. The most human—and humanizing—thing that we do.<br />
 <br />
The virtues of person-to-person conversation are timeless, and our most basic technology, talk, responds to our modern challenges. We have everything we need to start, we have each other. <br />

Quotes and thoughts while reading: <br />
<br />
"I have three chairs in my house; one for solitude, two for friendship, three for society." - Henry David Thoreau <br />
<br />
"Distracted at our dinner tables and living rooms, at our bisness meeting, and on our streets, we find taces of a new "silent spring" - a term Rachel Carson coined when we were ready to see that with technological chande had come an assult on our environment. Now, we have arrived at another moment of recognition. This time, technology is implicated in an assult on empthy. We have learned that... the very sight of a phone on the landscape leaves us feeling less connected to each other, less invested in each other."(p 4) I think the compatison to Rachel Carson is fascinating, because it puts everything in the same frame as environmental impact(which really this is just a different environment - a less physical environment - but still one that can be poisoned by technology.) We can think of fresh water ponds that have turned into samps or bogs by oil, and construct a metaphor to phones - that turned deep toughtful conversations into shallow vapid avenues for sharing what you saw - not what you thought. <br />
<br />
"Solitude reinforces a secure sense of self, and with that, the capacity for empthy. Then, conversation with others provides rich material for self-reflection. Just as alone we prepare to talk together, together we learn how to engage in a more productive solitude.... Technology disrupts this virtuous cycle. The disrutption begins with solitude, Thoreaus first chair... These days, we see that hwne people are alone at a stop sign or in the checkout line at the supermaket, they seem alsmost panicked and they reach for their phones. We are so assucstomed to ebing always connected that being alone seems like a problem technology should solve..."(p 10) Isn't this so true? Isn't this what you see when you are out and about in the world? People just being unwilling to be bored and alone? And I get that you could make the argument that people have always done this - they had newspapers, books, walkmans, radios - but there just seems to be something different with technology. Nicholas Carr posits that deep reading doesn't happen on a smart phone or computer - so even though the newspaper was there to escape into - there as different action on your brain. We'll talk more about this later.<br />
<br />
Pages 20 and 21 talk about about what conversation looks like now - it's more fragmented and people are popping in and out after checking things on their phones. "There are fewer conversations - not with the poeple you're tecting, but with the people around you!" Texting and emailing has given us this ability to "present the self we want to be. We can edit and retouch." But what does that mean for conversation - where thay action is impossible. I think that's where the meat of this book really lies - in trying to get people to realize that their very pursuit to present this perfect image of themselves is limiting their capacity to do just that. <br />
<br />
"On twitter, on Facebook, I'm geared toward showing my best shelf, showing me to be invulnerable or with as little vulnerability as possible."(p 24) I wonder what Burnet Brown has to say about that. I still feel like there are two camps - the fake it till you make it, and the wear your heart on your sleeve and be your true self. Which leads to healthier living? Which is more satisfying at the end of the day? To me - being your true self seems like the obvious choice - but that's not the choice that society is making today on the whole. We are more often not putting our masks on when we go online. And this is something I find so amazing - the internet first started as a place to take off your mask - the place you could swim into as your naked self - and there are still sites out there that allow this - but more and more often it feels like someone is watching you and you have to be careful what you say. It's just very interesting how that has changed. Before people maybe didn't realize the permanence of what is said online - and current users are taking note of that. There is a fear that what you do and say online will come back to haunt you. <br />

"A junior admits that wants to ask her friends to put away their phones at meals but she can't do it because she would be socilly out of line. 'It's hard to ask someone to give you their undivided attention.' She elaborates: Imagine me saying, "I'm happy to see you, would you mind putting your phone away so that we can have a nice breakfast conversation?" And they would think, "Well, that's really weird." Asking for full attention at a meal, she says, 'would be age innapropriate.'"(p 30) Aaaahhh - I just feel like screaming when I read this. Are you serious?! That is such a loving, caring sentence to approach someone with - that shows you truly want to engage with them - and you would get the response back of 'Well, that's really weird.' Ian asked me the other day if I was afraid of getting left behind because of my unwillingness to adopt new technological standards(we were talking about the iPhone 7 ditching the headphone jack) - and in all honesty - yes I am a bit afraid. But if falling behind means I can have conversations without phones out - or still ask people to put them away and receive flak for it - then I am totally willing to be left behind. That's not a future I want to accept as my norm. <br />
<br />
Life's Boring Bits talks all about the activities we no longer fully partake in because they are "boring". The one that stuck me the most was "A young father, thirty-four, tells me that when he gives his two-year-old daighter a bath, he finds it boring... Just a few nights earlier, instead of sitting patientl with her, talking and sining to her, as he did with his older children, he began to check email on his phone."(p 38) This isn't the only example of missing moments with your children because a phone comes in between you. Breastfeeding was also mentioned. I'm just struck with this feeling in the put of my stomache that fears for the relationships these parents will have with their kids. I don't remember my bath time, or breastfeeding, but I do know those activities made my mother feel closer to me - and that she has fond memories of them.<br />
<br />
<strong>"More generally, the experience of boredom is directly linked to creation and innovation... If we remain curious about our boredom, we can use it as a moment to step back and make a new connection. Or it offers a moment, as von KKleist would have it, to reach out and speak a thought that will emerge in connection with a listener."(p 39)</strong> <br />
<br />
I've had this conversation before with people - but it's always nice to see someone else writing about it. What I'm referencing is this idea of a friction free environment - it's what technologists have been marketing for years - and they do it by addressing your "pain points" - and how their new innovation can solve them. "But who said that a life without conflict, without being reminded of past mistakes, past pain, or one where you can avoid rubbing shoulders with troublesome poeple, is good? Was it the same person who said that life shouldn't have boring bits?...Just because technology can help us solve a "problem" doesn't mean it was a problem in the first place."(p 53)<br />
<br />
"Checkers with yout grandparents is an occasion to talk; checkers with a computer program is an occasion to strategize and perhaps be allowed to win... A fourteen-year-old girl sums up her feeling about spending an hour on Facebook: "Even if it just seeing the 'likes' on things I posted, I feel that I've accomplished something." What has she accomplished?"(p 63) Truly - what? Although I do feel like this has changed - people, at least in my life - are seeing Facebook as more of a time suck then they used to.<br />
<br />
"Language has created the world 'loneliness' to express the pain of being alone. And it has created the world 'solitude' to express the glory of being alone." - Paul Tillich (p 65) <br />
