Breasts

When I was 12 I would peek ay my mother and sister's Victoria's Secret catalogues. But unlike most boys my age instead of admiring the shapely bosoms of the models, I was learning the names and types on those glossy pages: racerback, demi cup, front clasp, push up, full coverage. Those undergarments shaped, held, and supported the breasts I so desperately wanted to have on my own body. I dreamed of nestling my breasts into the satin cups, fastening the catch around my back, and proudly thrusting out my chest.

The first bra I tried on was one I snuck from my sister'sâ€™ drawer; a simple blue training bra with adjustable straps, it hung loosely on my chest, yet tight in wrong places. I filled the cups with socks, but their weight was unsubstantial, with no movement or bounce. They were a very distant facsimile to the bust I craved; but under a shirt they brought eroticism and blush to my cheeks.

As a grown man, they still surround me, a vestige which has yet to adorn my chest. With lovers' I have longingly embraced their areola tipped mounds, wanting to feel what they feel, saliva tipped peaks, wishing my breasts reflected theirs. I have revealed my secret desire to only a few. The most unnerving were those who guessed. The rest are always suprised at how adeptly I can relase the clasp of their bra, never suspecting that I have realised my own clasp.
