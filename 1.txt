Robin

Dawn breaks the tranquility of the nest,
With days first beams of light 
songs burst forth.
As seasons pass, flights are taken.
Broad swaths of land are covered;
and migration is guided by an unknown interior force.
The desire to travel sweeps up your wings,
and you take flight.
From pacific coasts, to eastern shores,
the morning call reverberates.
Each new location greets you,
and a home is built.
As twigs are gathered, and feathers lost;
the unknowable desire awakens,
and again you take flight.
