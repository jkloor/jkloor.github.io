The exciting realism of air adventure - through the treacherous passes of the Pyrenees, above the Sahara, along the snowy
ramparts of the Andes - combined with lyrical prose and the soaring spirit of a philosopher, makes these memoirs one of the 
most popular books about flying every written. The author was a pioneer pilot in commercial aviation. During World War II he
served in a French air squadron and in the summer of 1944 disappeared over the Mediterranean while returning from a reconnaissance
mission. He has been called "the Joseph Conrad of the air", and this account of his experiences received the Grand Prix of the 
Academie Francaise. <br />
