There are faces, and names
gathered around this table
that are as varied and different
as the ingredients we see assembled before us.

Like the salt and pepper in each dish,
we share the same basic truths,
but some have saffron, 
and others ginger;
making us unique and dissimilar.

We say thanks,
not only for the food we see in front of us,
but the smiles reflected back, 
the laughter that will abound, 
and the memories that will continue to exist so far past this table.

Knoernschild to Kloor,
Duban to Brunson,
and all those in between,
we are here as a celebration of family.
Of that special bond.
