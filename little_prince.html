From the back of the book: <br />
<br />
No story is more beloved by children and grownups alike than this wise, enchanting fable. One day, the author reminisces,
when his plane was forced down in the Sahara a thousand miles from help, he encountered a most extraordinary small person.
"If you please", said the stranger, "draw me a sheep". And thus begins the remarkable history of the Little Prince. <br />
<br />
The Little Prince lived alone on a tiny planet no larger than a house. He owned three volcanoes, two active and one extinct. 
He also owned a flower, unlike an flower in all the galaxy, of great beauty and of inordinate pride. It was this pride that 
ruined the serenity of the Little Prince's world and started him on the interplanetary travels that brought him to Earth, 
where he learned finally, from a fox, the secret of what is really important in life. <br />
<br />
There are a few stories that in some way, in some degree, change the world forever for their readers. This is one. <br />

Quotes: <br />
<br />
"The grown-ups are certainly very odd." <br />
<br />
"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye." <br />
