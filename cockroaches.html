<p align="left">When the Norwegian ambassador to Thailand is found dead in a Bangkok   brothel, Inspector Harry Hole is dispatched from Oslo to help hush up   the case.<br /><br />
But once he arrives Harry discovers that   this case is about much more than one random murder. There is something   else, something more pervasive, scrabbling around behind the scenes. Or,   put another way, for every cockroach you see in your hotel room, there   are hundreds behind the walls. Surrounded by round-the-clock traffic   noise, Harry wanders the streets of Bangkok lined with go-go bars,   temples, opium dens, and tourist traps, trying to piece together the   story of the ambassador&rsquo;s death even though no one asked him to, and no   one wants him toâ€”not even Harry himself.
