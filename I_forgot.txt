For the first time in 6 years I forgot. 
I forgot the day I cried on my friends shoulder. 
I forgot the buzz of my phone, 
and the slack jaw imprinted on my face as the call ended. 

I forgot the woman who offered to give me her seat,
or to rent a car and drive me to San Francisco.
And I forgot the weight of it all on my shoulder,
as I and five others walked down the pew rimmed rows.

February 1, 2009.
I am so elated, 
and so crushed,
that I forgot.
