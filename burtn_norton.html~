<p style="margin-left: 10%">

Time present and time past<br>
Are both perhaps present in time future<br>
And time future contained in time past.<br>
If all time is eternally present<br>
All time is unredeemable.<br>
What might have been is an abstraction<br>

Remaining a perpetual possibility<br>
Only in a world of speculation.<br>
What might have been and what has been<br>
Point to one end, which is always present.<br>
Footfalls echo in the memory<br>
Down the passage which we did not take<br>
Towards the door we never opened<br>
Into the rose-garden. My words echo<br>
Thus, in your mind.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;But to what purpose<br>
Disturbing the dust on a bowl of rose-leaves<br>
I do not know.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;Other echoes<br>
Inhabit the garden. Shall we follow?<br>
Quick, said the bird, find them, find them,<br>
Round the corner. Through the first gate,<br>
Into our first world, shall we follow<br>
The deception of the thrush? Into our first world.<br>
There they were, dignified, invisible,<br>
Moving without pressure, over the dead leaves,<br>
In the autumn heat, through the vibrant air,<br>
And the bird called, in response to<br>
The unheard music hidden in the shrubbery,<br>
And the unseen eyebeam crossed, for the roses<br>
Had the look of flowers that are looked at.<br>
There they were as our guests, accepted and accepting.<br>
So we moved, and they, in a formal pattern,<br>
Along the empty alley, into the box circle,<br>
To look down into the drained pool.<br>
Dry the pool, dry concrete, brown edged,<br>
And the pool was filled with water out of sunlight,<br>
And the lotos rose, quietly, quietly,<br>
The surface glittered out of heart of light,<br>
And they were behind us, reflected in the pool.<br>
Then a cloud passed, and the pool was empty.<br>
Go, said the bird, for the leaves were full of children,<br>
Hidden excitedly, containing laughter.<br>
Go, go, go, said the bird: human kind<br>
Cannot bear very much reality.<br>
Time past and time future<br>
What might have been and what has been<br>
Point to one end, which is always present.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
Garlic and sapphires in the mud<br>
Clot the bedded axle-tree.<br>
The trilling wire in the blood<br>
Sings below inveterate scars<br>
Appeasing long forgotten wars.<br>
The dance along the artery<br>
The circulation of the lymph<br>
Are figured in the drift of stars<br>
Ascend to summer in the tree<br>
We move above the moving tree<br>
In light upon the figured leaf<br>
And hear upon the sodden floor<br>
Below, the boarhound and the boar<br>
Pursue their pattern as before<br>
But reconciled among the stars.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor
        fleshless;<br>
Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance
        is,<br>
But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity,<br>
Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from
        nor towards,<br>
Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still
        point,<br>
There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.<br>
I can only say, <i>there</i> we have been: but I cannot say where.<br>
And I cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time.<br>
The inner freedom from the practical desire,<br>
The release from action and suffering, release from the
        inner<br>
And the outer compulsion, yet surrounded<br>
By a grace of sense, a white light still and moving,<br>
<i>Erhebung</i> without motion, concentration<br>
Without elimination, both a new world<br>
And the old made explicit, understood<br>
In the completion of its partial ecstasy,<br>
The resolution of its partial horror.<br>
Yet the enchainment of past and future<br>
Woven in the weakness of the changing body,<br>
Protects mankind from heaven and damnation<br>
Which flesh cannot endure.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Time past and time future<br>
Allow but a little consciousness.<br>
To be conscious is not to be in time<br>
But only in time can the moment in the rose-garden,<br>
The moment in the arbour where the rain beat,<br>
The moment in the draughty church at smokefall<br>
Be remembered; involved with past and future.<br>
Only through time time is conquered.</p>


<p style="margin-left: 20%">III</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
Here is a place of disaffection<br>
Time before and time after<br>
In a dim light: neither daylight<br>
Investing form with lucid stillness<br>
Turning shadow into transient beauty<br>
Wtih slow rotation suggesting permanence<br>
Nor darkness to purify the soul<br>
Emptying the sensual with deprivation<br>
Cleansing affection from the temporal.<br>
Neither plentitude nor vacancy. Only a flicker<br>
Over the strained time-ridden faces<br>
Distracted from distraction by distraction<br>
Filled with fancies and empty of meaning<br>
Tumid apathy with no concentration<br>
Men and bits of paper, whirled by the cold wind<br>
That blows before and after time,<br>
Wind in and out of unwholesome lungs<br>
Time before and time after.<br>
Eructation of unhealthy souls<br>
Into the faded air, the torpid<br>
Driven on the wind that sweeps the gloomy hills of London,<br>
Hampstead and Clerkenwell, Campden and Putney,<br>
Highgate, Primrose and Ludgate. Not here<br>
Not here the darkness, in this twittering world.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descend lower, descend only<br>
Into the world of perpetual solitude,<br>
World not world, but that which is not world,<br>
Internal darkness, deprivation<br>
And destitution of all property,<br>
Dessication of the world of sense,<br>
Evacuation of the world of fancy,<br>
Inoperancy of the world of spirit;<br>
This is the one way, and the other<br>
Is the same, not in movement<br>
But abstention from movememnt; while the world moves<br>
In appetency, on its metalled ways<br>
Of time past and time future.</p>


<p style="margin-left: 20%">IV</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
Time and the bell have buried the day,<br>
the black cloud carries the sun away.<br>
Will the sunflower turn to us, will the clematis<br>
Stray down, bend to us; tendril and spray<br>
Clutch and cling?<br>
Chill<br>
Fingers of yew be curled<br>
Down on us? After the kingfisher's wing<br>
Has answered light to light, and is silent, the light is still<br>
At the still point of the turning world.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%">V</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
Words move, music moves<br>
Only in time; but that which is only living<br>
Can only die. Words, after speech, reach<br>
Into the silence. Only by the form, the pattern,<br>
Can words or music reach<br>
The stillness, as a Chinese jar still<br>
Moves perpetually in its stillness.<br>
Not the stillness of the violin, while the note lasts,<br>
Not that only, but the co-existence,<br>
Or say that the end precedes the beginning,<br>
And the end and the beginning were always there<br>
Before the beginning and after the end.<br>
And all is always now. Words strain,<br>
Crack and sometimes break, under the burden,<br>
Under the tension, slip, slide, perish,<br>
Will not stay still. Shrieking voices<br>
Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering,<br>
Always assail them. The Word in the desert<br>
Is most attacked by voices of temptation,<br>
The crying shadow in the funeral dance,<br>
The loud lament of the disconsolate chimera.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detail of the pattern is movement,<br>
As in the figure of the ten stairs.<br>
Desire itself is movement<br>
Not in itself desirable;<br>
Love is itself unmoving,<br>
Only the cause and end of movement,<br>
Timeless, and undesiring<br>
Except in the aspect of time<br>
Caught in the form of limitation<br>
Between un-being and being.<br>
Sudden in a shaft of sunlight<br>
Even while the dust moves<br>
There rises the hidden laughter<br>
Of children in the foliage<br>
Quick now, here, now, always-<br>
Ridiculous the waste sad time<br>
Stretching before and after.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%">I</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In my beginning is my end. In succession<br>
Houses rise and fall, crumble, are extended,<br>
Are removed, destroyed, restored, or in their place<br>
Is an open field, or a factory, or a by-pass.<br>
Old stone to new building, old timber to new fires,<br>
Old fires to ashes, and ashes to the earth<br>
Which is already flesh, fur and faeces,<br>
Bone of man and beast, cornstalk and leaf.<br>
Houses live and die: there is a time for building<br>
And a time for living and for generation<br>
And a time for the wind to break the loosened pane<br>
And to shake the wainscot where the field-mouse trots<br>
And to shake the tattered arras woven with a silent motto.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In my beginning is my end. Now the light falls<br>
Across the open field,, leaving the deep lane<br>
Shuttered with branches, dark in the afternoon,<br>
Where you lean against a bank while a van passes,<br>
And the deep lane insists on the direction<br>
Into the village, in the elctric heat<br>
Hypnotised. In a warm haze the sultry light<br>
Is absorbed, not refracted, by grey stone.<br>
The dahlias sleep in the empty silence.<br>
Wait for the early owl.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;In that open field<br>
If you do not come too close, if you do not come too close,<br>
On a summer midnight, you can hear the music<br>
Of the weak pipe and the little drum<br>
And see them dancing around the bonfire<br>
the association of man and woman<br>
In daunsinge, signifying matrimonie˜<br>
A dignified and commodious sacrament.<br>
Two and two, necessarye coniunction,<br>
Holding eche other by the hand or the arm<br>
Whiche betokeneth concorde. Round and round the fire<br>
Leaping through the flames, or joined in circles,<br>
Rustically solemn or in rustic laughter<br>
Lifting heavy feet in clumsy shoes,<br>
Earth feet, loam feet, lifted in country mirth<br>
Mirth of those long since under earth<br>
Nourishing the corn. Keeping time,<br>
Keeping the rhythm in their dancing<br>
As in their living in the living seasons<br>
The time of the seasons and the constellations<br>
The time of milking and the time of harvest<br>
The time of the coupling of man and woman<br>
And that of beasts. Feet rising and falling.<br>
Eating and drinking. Dung and death.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dawn points, and another day<br>
Prepares for heat and silence. Out at sea the dawn wind<br>
Wrinkles and slides. I am here<br>
Or there, or elsewhere. In my beginning.</p>


<p style="margin-left: 10%">II</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
What is the late November doing<br>
With the disturbance of the spring<br>
And creatures of the summer heat,<br>
And snowdrops writhing under feet<br>
And hollyhocks that aim too high<br>
Red into grey and tumble down<br>
Late roses filled with early snow?<br>
Thunder rolled by the rolling stars<br>
Simulates triumphal cars<br>
Deployed in constellated wars<br>
Scorpion fights against the Sun<br>
Until the Sun and Moon go down<br>
Comets weep and Leonids fly<br>
Hunt the heavens and the plains<br>
Whirled in a vortex that shall bring<br>
The world to that destructive fire<br>
Which burns before the ice-cap reigns.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That was a way of putting it - not very satisfactory:<br>
A periphrastic study in a worn-out poetical fashion,<br>
Leaving one still with the intolerable wrestle<br>
With words and meanings. The poetry does not matter.<br>
It was not (to start again) what one had expected.<br>
What was to be the value of the long looked forward to,<br>
Long hoped for calm, the autumnal serenity<br>
And the wisdom of age? Had they deceived us,<br>
Or deceived themselves, the quiet-voiced elders,<br>
Bequeathing us merely a receipt for deceit?<br>
The serenity only a deliberate hebetude,<br>
The wisdom only the knowledge of dead secrets<br>
Useless in the darkness into which they peered<br>
Or from which they turned their eyes. There is, it seems to
        us,<br>
At best, only a limited value<br>
In the knowledge derived from experience.<br>
The knowledge inposes a pattern, and falsifies,<br>
For the pattern is new in every moment<br>
And every moment is a new and shocking<br>
Valuation of all we have been. We are only undeceived<br>
Of that which, deceiving, could no longer harm.<br>
In the middle, not only in the middle of the way<br>
but all the way, in a dark wood, in a bramble,<br>
On the edge of a grimpen, where is no secure foothold,<br>
And menaced by monsters, fancy lights,<br>
Risking enchantment. Do not let me hear<br>
Of the wisdom of old men, but rahter of their folly,<br>
Their fear of fear and frenzy, their fear of possession,<br>
Of belonging to another, or to others, or to God.<br>
The only wisdom we can hope to acquire<br>
Is the wisdom of humility: humility is endless.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%">III</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
O dark dark dark. They all go into the dark,<br>
The vacant interstellar spaces, the vacant into the vacant,<br>
The captains, merchant bankers, eminent men of letters,<br>
The generous patrons of art, the statesmen and the rulers,<br>
Distinguished civil servants, chairmen of many committees,<br>
Industrial lords and petty contractors, all go into the dark,<br>
And dark the Sun and Moon, and the Almanach de Gotha<br>
And the Stock Exchange Gazette, the Directory of Directors,<br>
And cold the sense and lost the motive of action.<br>
And we all go with them, into the silent funeral,<br>
Nobody's funeral, for there is no one to bury.<br>
I said to my soul, be still, and let the dark come upon you<br>
Which shall be the darkness of God. As, in a theatre,<br>
The lights are extinguished, for the scene to be changed<br>
With a hollow rumble of wings, with a movement of darkness
        on darkness,<br>
And we know that the hills and the trees, the distant
        panorama<br>
And the bold imposing facade are all being rolled away-<br>
Or as, when an underground train, in the tube, stops too
        long between stations<br>
And the conversation rises and slowly fades into silence<br>
And you see behind every face the mental emptiness deepen<br>
Leaving only the growing terror of nothing to think about;<br>
Or when, under ether, the mind is conscious but conscious
        of nothing-<br>
I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope<br>
For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without
        love,<br>
For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith<br>
But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the
        waiting.<br>
Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought:<br>
So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the
        dancing.<br>
Whisper of running streams, and winter lightning.<br>
The wild thyme unseen and the wild strawberry,<br>
The laughter in the garden, echoed ecstasy<br>
Not lost, but requiring, pointing to the agony<br>
Of death and birth.</p>

&nbsp;You say I am repeating<br>
Something I have said before. I shall say it again.<br>
Shall I say it again? In order to arrive there,<br>
To arrive where you are, to get from where you are not,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   You must go by a way wherein there is no ecstacy.<br>
In order to arrive at what you do not know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   You must go by a way which is the way of ignorance.<br>
In order to possess what you do not possess<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   You must go by the way of dispossession.<br>
In order to arrive at what you are not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   You must go through the way in which you are not.<br>
And what you do not know is the only thing you know<br>
And what you own is what you do not own<br>
And where you are is where you are not.</p>

The wounded surgeon plies the steel<br>
That quesions the distempered part;<br>
Beneath the bleeding hands we feel<br>
The sharp compassion of the healer's art<br>
Resolving the enigma of the fever chart.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
Our only health is the disease<br>
If we obey the dying nurse<br>
Whose constant care is not to please<br>
But to remind us of our, and Adam's curse,<br>
And that, to be restored, our sickness must grow worse.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
The whole earth is our hospital<br>
Endowed by the ruined millionaire,<br>
Wherein, if we do well, we shall<br>
Die of the absolute paternal care<br>

The chill ascends from feet to knees,<br>
The fever sings in mental wires.<br>
If to be warmed, then I must freeze<br>
And quake in frigid purgatorial fires<br>
Of which the flame is roses, and the smoke is briars.</p>

The dripping blood our only drink,<br>
The bloody flesh our only food:<br>
In spite of which we like to think<br>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
So here I am, in the middle way, having had twenty years-<br>
Twenty years largely wasted, the years of <i>l'entre deux guerres-</i><br>
Trying to use words, and every attempt<br>
Is a wholy new start, and a different kind of failure<br>
Because one has only learnt to get the better of words<br>
For the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which<br>
One is no longer disposed to say it. And so each venture<br>
Is a new beginning, a raid on the inarticulate,<br>
With shabby equipment always deteriorating<br>
In the general mess of imprecision of feeling,<br>
Undisciplined squads of emotion. And what there is to conquer<br>
By strength and submission, has already been discovered<br>
Once or twice, or several times, by men whom one cannot hope<br>
To emulate - but there is no competition -<br>
There is only the fight to recover what has been lost<br>
And found and lost again and again: and now, under conditions<br>
That seem unpropitious. But perhaps neither gain nor loss.<br>
For us, there is only the trying. The rest is not our
        business.</p><br>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
Home is where one starts from. As we grow older<br>
the world becomes stranger, the pattern more complicated<br>
Of dead and living. Not the intense moment<br>
Isolated, with no before and after,<br>
But a lifetime burning in every moment<br>
And not the lifetime of one man only<br>
But of old stones that cannot be deciphered.<br>
There is a time for the evening under starlight,<br>
A time for the evening under lamplight<br>
(The evening with the photograph album).<br>
Love is most nearly itself<br>
When here and now cease to matter.<br>
Old men ought to be explorers<br>
Here or there does not matter<br>
We must be still and still moving<br>
Into another intensity<br>
For a further union, a deeper communion<br>
Through the dark cold and the empty desolation,<br>
The wave cry, the wind cry, the vast waters<br>
Of the petrel and the porpoise. In my end is my beginning.</p>

I do not know much about gods; but I think that the river<br>
Is a strong brown god - sullen, untamed and intractable,<br>
Patient to some degree, at first recognised as a frontier;<br>
Useful, untrustworthy, as a conveyor of commerce;<br>
Then only a problem confronting the builder of bridges.<br>
The problem once solved, the brown god is almost forgotten<br>
By the dwellers in cities - ever, however, implacable.<br>
Keeping his seasons, and rages, destroyer, reminder<br>
Of what men choose to forget. Unhonoured, unpropitiated<br>
By worshippers of the machine, but waiting, watching and
        waiting.<br>
His rhythm was present in the nursery bedroom,<br>
In the rank ailanthus of the April dooryard,<br>
In the smell of grapes on the autumn table,<br>
And the evening circle in the winter gaslight.</p>

The river is within us, the sea is all about us;<br>
The sea is the land's edge also, the granite,<br>
Into which it reaches, the beaches where it tosses<br>
Its hints of earlier and other creation:<br>
The starfish, the horseshoe crab, the whale's backbone;<br>
The pools where it offers to our curiosity<br>
The more delicate algae and the sea anemone.<br>
It tosses up our losses, the torn seine,<br>
The shattered lobsterpot, the broken oar<br>
And the gear of foreign dead men. The sea has many voices,<br>
Many gods and many voices.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea howl<br>
And the sea yelp, are different voices<br>
Often together heard: the whine in the rigging,<br>
The menace and caress of wave that breaks on water,<br>
The distant rote in the granite teeth,<br>
And the wailing warning form the approaching headland<br>
Are all sea voices, and the heaving groaner<br>
Rounded homewards, and the seagull:<br>
And under the oppression of the silent fog<br>
The tolling bell<br>
Measures time not our time, rung by the unhurried<br>
Ground swell, a time<br>
Older than the time of chronometers, older<br>
Than time counted by anxious worried women<br>
Lying awake, calculating the future,<br>
Trying to unweave, unwind, unravel<br>
And piece together the past and the future,<br>
Between midnight and dawn, when the past is all deception,<br>
The future futureless, before the morning watch<br>
Whem time stops and time is never ending;<br>
And the ground swell, that is and was from the beginning,<br>
Clangs<br>
The bell.</p>

Where is there an end of it, the soundless wailing,<br>
The silent withering of autumn flowers<br>
Dropping their petals and remaining motionless;<br>
Where is there and end to the drifting wreckage,<br>
The prayer of the bone on the beach, the unprayable<br>
Prayer at the calamitous annunciation?</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">

There is no end, but addition: the trailing<br>
Consequence of further days and hours,<br>

Years of living among the breakage<br>
Of what was believed in as the most reliable-<br>
And therefore the fittest for renunciation.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is the final addition, the failing<br>
Pride or resentment at failing powers,<br>
The unattached devotion which might pass for devotionless,<br>
In a drifting boat with a slow leakage,<br>
The silent listening to the undeniable<br>
Clamour of the bell of the last annunciation.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where is the end of them, the fishermen sailing<br>
Into the wind's tail, where the fog cowers?<br>
We cannot think of a time that is oceanless<br>
Or of an ocean not littered with wastage<br>
Or of a future that is not liable<br>
Like the past, to have no destination.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have to think of them as forever bailing,<br>
Setting and hauling, while the North East lowers<br>
Over shallow banks unchanging and erosionless<br>
Or drawing their money, drying sails at dockage;<br>
Not as making a trip that will be unpayable<br>
For a haul that will not bear examination.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is no end of it, the voiceless wailing,<br>
No end to the withering of withered flowers,<br>
To the movement of pain that is painless and motionless,<br>
To the drift of the sea and the drifting wreckage,<br>
The bone's prayer to Death its God. Only the hardly, barely
        prayable<br>
Prayer of the one Annunciation.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It seems, as one becomes older,<br>
That the past has another pattern, and ceases to be a mere
        sequence-<br>
Or even development: the latter a partial fallacy<br>
Encouraged by superficial notions of evolution,<br>
Which becomes, in the popular mind, a means of disowning the
        past.<br>
The moments of happiness - not the sense of well-being,<br>
Fruition, fulfilment, security or affecton,<br>
Or even a very good dinner, but the sudden illumination—<br>
We had the experience but missed the meaning,<br>
And approach to the meaning restores the experience<br>
In a different form, beyond any meaning<br>
We can assign to happiness. I have said before<br>
That the past experience revived in the meaning<br>
Is not the experience of one life only<br>
But of many generations - not forgetting<br>
Something that is probably quite ineffable:<br>
The backward look behind the assurance<br>
Of recorded history, the backward half-look<br>
Over the shoulder, towards the primitive terror.<br>
Now, we come to discover that the moments of agony<br>
(Whether, or not, due to misunderstanding,<br>
Having hoped for the wrong things or dreaded the wrong things,<br>
Is not in question) are likewise permanent<br>
With such permanence as time has. We appreciate this better<br>
In the agony of others, nearly experienced,<br>
Involving ourselves, than in our own.<br>
For our own past is covered by the currents of action,<br>
But the torment of others remains an experience<br>
Unqualified, unworn by subsequent attrition.<br>
People change, and smile: but the agony abides.<br>
Time the destroyer is time the preserver,<br>
Like the river with its cargo of dead negroes, cows and chicken
        coops,<br>
The bitter apple, and the bite in the apple.<br>
And the ragged rock in the restless waters,<br>
Waves wash over it, fogs conceal it;<br>
On a halcyon day it is merely a monument,<br>
In navigable weather it is always a seamark<br>
To lay a course by, but in the sombre season<br>
Or the sudden fury, is what it always was.</p>


<p style="margin-left: 20%">III</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
I sometimes wonder if that is what Krishna meant-<br>
Among other things - or one way of putting the same thing:<br>
That the future is a faded song, a Royal Rose or a lavender spray<br>
Of wistful regret for those who are not yet here to regret,<br>
Pressed between yellow leaves of a book that has never been
        opened.<br>
And the way up is the way down, the way forward is the way back.<br>
You cannot face it steadily, but this thing is sure,<br>
That time is no healer: the patient is no longer here.<br>
When the train starts, and the passengers are settled<br>
To fruit, periodicals and business letters<br>
(And those who saw them off have left the platform)<br>
Their faces relax from grief into relief,<br>
To the sleepy rhythm of a hundred hours.<br>
Fare forward, travellers! not escaping from the past<br>
Into different lives, or into any future;<br>
You are not the same people who left that station<br>
Or who will arrive at any terminus,<br>
While the narrowing rails slide together behind you;<br>
Watching the furrow that widens behind you,<br>
You shall not think "the past is finished"<br>
Or "the future is before us".<br>
At nightfall, in the rigging and the aerial,<br>
Is a voice descanting (though not to the ear,<br>
The murmuring shell of time, and not in any language)<br>
"Fare forward, you who think that you are voyaging;<br>
You are not those who saw the harbour<br>
Receding, or those who will disembark.<br>
Here between the hither and the farther shore<br>
While time is withdrawn, consider the future<br>
And the past with an equal mind.<br>
At the moment which is not of action or inaction<br>
You can receive this: 'on  whatever sphere of being<br>
The mind of a man may be intent<br>
At the time of death' - that is the one action<br>
(And the time of death is every moment)<br>
Which shall fructify in the lives of others:<br>
And do not think of the fruit of action.<br>
Fare forward.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;O voyagers, O seamen,<br>
You who came to port, and you whose bodies<br>
Will suffer the trial and judgement of the sea,<br>
Or whatever event, this is your real destination."<br>
So Krishna, as when he admonished Arjuna<br>
On the field of battle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Not fare well,<br>
But fare forward, voyagers.</p>

With playing cards, fiddle with pentagrams<br>
Or barbituric acids, or dissect<br>

Men's curiosity searches past and future<br>
And clings to that dimension. But to apprehend<br>
The point of intersection of the timeless<br>
With time, is an occupation for the saint—<br>
No occupation either, but something given<br>
And taken, in a lifetime's death in love,<br>
Ardour and selflessness and self-surrender.<br>
For most of us, there is only the unattended<br>
Moment, the moment in and out of time,<br>

The wild thyme unseen, or the winter lightning<br>
Or the waterfall, or music heard so deeply<br>
That it is not heard at all, but you are the music<br>
While the music lasts. These are only hints and guesses,<br>
Hints followed by guesses; and the rest<br>
Is prayer, observance, discipline, thought and action.<br>

Here the impossible union<br>
Of spheres of evidence is actual,<br>
Here the past and future<br>
Are conquered, and reconciled,<br>
Where action were otherwise movement<br>
Of that which is only moved<br>
And has in it no source of movement—<br>
Driven by daemonic, chthonic<br>
Powers. And right action is freedom<br>
From past and future also.<br>
For most of us, this is the aim<br>
Never here to be realised;<br>
Who are only undefeated<br>
Because we have gone on trying;<br>
We, content at the last<br>
If our temporal reversion nourish<br>
(Not too far from the yew-tree)<br>

Midwinter spring is its own season<br>
Sempiternal though sodden towards sundown,<br>
Suspended in time, between pole and tropic.<br>
Whem the short day is brightest, with frost and fire,<br>
The brief sun flames the ice, on pond and ditches,<br>
In windless cold that is the heart's heat,<br>
Reflecting in a watery mirror<br>
A glare that is blindness in the early afternoon.<br>
And glow more intense than blaze of branch, or brazier,<br>
Stirs the dumb spirit: no wind, but pentecostal fire<br>
In the dark time of the year. Between melting and freezing<br>
The soul's sap quivers. There is no earth smell<br>
Or smell of living thing. This is the spring time<br>
But not in time's covenant. Now the hedgerow<br>
Is blanched for an hour with transitory blossom<br>
Of snow, a bloom more sudden<br>
Than that of summer, neither budding nor fading,<br>
Not in the scheme of generation.<br>
Where is the summer, the unimaginable<br>
Zero summer?</p>

Taking the route you would be likely to take<br>
From the place you would be likely to come from,<br>
If you came this way in may time, you would find the hedges<br>
White again, in May, with voluptuary sweetness.<br>
It would be the same at the end of the journey,<br>
If you came at night like a broken king,<br>
If you came by day not knowing what you came for,<br>
It would be the same, when you leave the rough road<br>
And turn behind the pig-sty to the dull facade<br>
And the tombstone. And what you thought you came for<br>
Is only a shell, a husk of meaning<br>
From which the purpose breaks only when it is fulfilled<br>
If at all. Either you had no purpose<br>
Or the purpose is beyond the end you figured<br>
And is altered in fulfilment. There are other places<br>
Which also are the world's end, some at the sea jaws,<br>
Or over a dark lake, in a desert or a city—<br>
But this is the nearest, in place and time,<br>

Sense and notion. You are not here to verify,<br>
Instruct yourself, or inform curiosity<br>
Or carry report. You are here to kneel<br>
Where prayer has been valid. And prayer is more<br>
Than an order of words, the conscious occupation<br>
Of the praying mind, or the sound of the voice praying.<br>
And what the dead had no speech for, when living,<br>
They can tell you, being dead: the communication<br>
Of the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the
        living.<br>
Here, the intersection of the timeless moment<br>
Is England and nowhere. Never and always.</p>

Ash on an old man's sleeve<br>

In the uncertain hour before the morning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near the ending of interminable night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the recurrent end of the unending<br>
After the dark dove with the flickering tongue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had passed below the horizon of his homing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the dead leaves still rattled on like tin<br>
Over the asphalt where no other sound was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between three districts whence the smoke arose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met one walking, loitering and hurried<br>
As if blown towards me like the metal leaves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the urban dawn wind unresisting.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as I fixed upon the down-turned face<br>
That pointed scrutiny with which we challenge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first-met stranger in the waning dusk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I caught the sudden look of some dead master<br>
Whom I had known, forgotten, half recalled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both one and many; in the brown baked features<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of a familiar compound ghost<br>
Both intimate and unidentifiable.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I assumed a double part, and cried<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heard another's voice cry: "What! are <i>you</i> here?"<br>
Although we were not. I was still the same,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing myself yet being someone other—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he a face still forming; yet the words sufficed<br>
To compel the recognition they preceded.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, compliant to the common wind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too strange to each other for misunderstanding,<br>
In concord at this intersection time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of meeting nowhere, no before and after,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We trod the pavement in a dead patrol.<br>
I said: "The wonder that I feel is easy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet ease is cause of wonder. Therefore speak:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may not comprehend, may not remember."<br>
And he: "I am not eager to rehearse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My thoughts and theory which you have forgotten.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things have served their purpose: let them be.<br>
So with your own, and pray they be forgiven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By others, as I pray you to forgive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both bad and good. Last season's fruit is eaten<br>
And the fullfed beast shall kick the empty pail.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For last year's words belong to last year's language<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And next year's words await another voice.<br>
But, as the passage now presents no hindrance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the spirit unappeased and peregrine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between two worlds become much like each other,<br>
So I find words I never thought to speak<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In streets I never thought I should revisit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I left my body on a distant shore.<br>
Since our concern was speech, and speech impelled us<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To purify the dialect of the tribe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And urge the mind to aftersight and foresight,<br>
Let me disclose the gifts reserved for age<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set a crown upon your lifetime's effort.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the cold fricton of expiring sense<br>
Without enchantment, offering no promise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But bitter tastelessness of shadow fruit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As body and sould begin to fall asunder.<br>
Second, the conscious impotence of rage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At human folly, and the laceration<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of laughter at what ceases to amuse.<br>
And last, the rending pain of re-enactment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all that you have done, and been; the shame<br>
Of things ill done and done to others' harm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which once you took for exercise of virtue.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then fools' approval stings, and honour stains.<br>
From wrong to wrong the exasperated spirit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proceeds, unless restored by that refining fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you must move in measure, like a dancer."<br>
The day was breaking. In the disfigured street<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left me, with a kind of valediction,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And faded on the blowing of the horn.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%">III</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
There are three conditions which often look alike<br>
Yet differ completely, flourish in the same hedgerow:<br>
Attachment to self and to things and to persons, detachment<br>
From self and from things and from persons; and, growing between
        them, indifference<br>
Which resembles the others as death resembles life,<br>
Being between two lives - unflowering, between<br>
The live and the dead nettle. This is the use of memory:<br>
For liberation - not less of love but expanding<br>
Of love beyond desire, and so liberation<br>
From the future as well as the past. Thus, love of a country<br>
Begins as an attachment to our own field of action<br>
And comes to find that action of little importance<br>
Though never indifferent. History may be servitude,<br>
History may be freedom. See, now they vanish,<br>
The faces and places, with the self which, as it could, loved
        them,<br>
To become renewed, transfigured, in another pattern.<br>
Sin is Behovely, but<br>
All shall be well, and<br>
All manner of thing shall be well.<br>
If I think, again, of this place,<br>
And of people, not wholly commendable,<br>
Of not immediate kin or kindness,<br>
But of some peculiar genius,<br>
All touched by a common genius,<br>
United in the strife which divided them;<br>
If I think of a king at nightfall,<br>
Of three men, and more, on the scaffold<br>
And a few who died forgotten<br>
In other places, here and abroad,<br>
And of one who died blind and quiet,<br>
Why should we celebrate<br>
These dead men more than the dying?<br>
It is not to ring the bell backward<br>
Nor is it an incantation<br>
To summon the spectre of a Rose.<br>
We cannot revive old factions<br>
We cannot restore old policies<br>
Or follow an antique drum.<br>
These men, and those who opposed them<br>
And those whom they opposed<br>
Accept the constitution of silence<br>
And are folded in a single party.<br>
Whatever we inherit from the fortunate<br>
We have taken from the defeated<br>
What they had to leave us - a symbol:<br>
A symbol perfected in death.<br>
And all shall be well and<br>
All manner of thing shall be well<br>
By the purification of the motive<br>
In the ground of our beseeching.</p>

The dove descending breaks the air<br>
With flame of incandescent terror<br>
Of which the tongues declare<br>
The one dischage from sin and error.<br>
The only hope, or else despair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies in the choice of pyre of pyre-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be redeemed from fire by fire.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
Who then devised the torment? Love.<br>
Love is the unfamiliar Name<br>
Behind the hands that wove<br>
The intolerable shirt of flame<br>
Which human power cannot remove.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We only live, only suspire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumed by either fire or fire.</p>

What we call the beginning is often the end<br>
And to make and end is to make a beginning.<br>
The end is where we start from. And every phrase<br>
And sentence that is right (where every word is at home,<br>
Taking its place to support the others,<br>
The word neither diffident nor ostentatious,<br>
An easy commerce of the old and the new,<br>
The common word exact without vulgarity,<br>
The formal word precise but not pedantic,<br>
The complete consort dancing together)<br>
Every phrase and every sentence is an end and a beginning,<br>
Every poem an epitaph. And any action<br>
Is a step to the block, to the fire, down the sea's throat<br>
Or to an illegible stone: and that is where we start.<br>
We die with the dying:<br>
See, they depart, and we go with them.<br>
We are born with the dead:<br>
See, they return, and bring us with them.<br>
The moment of the rose and the moment of the yew-tree<br>
Are of equal duration. A people without history<br>
Is not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern<br>
Of timeless moments. So, while the light fails<br>
On a winter's afternoon, in a secluded chapel<br>
History is now and England.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
With the drawing of this Love and the voice of this Calling</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%">
We shall not cease from exploration<br>
And the end of all our exploring<br>
Will be to arrive where we started<br>
And know the place for the first time.<br>
Through the unknown, unremembered gate<br>
When the last of earth left to discover<br>
Is that which was the beginning;<br>
At the source of the longest river<br>
The voice of the hidden waterfall<br>
And the children in the apple-tree<br>
Not known, because not looked for<br>
But heard, half-heard, in the stillness<br>
Between two waves of the sea.<br>
Quick now, here, now, always—<br>
A condition of complete simplicity<br>
(Costing not less than everything)<br>
And all shall be well and<br>
All manner of thing shall be well<br>
When the tongues of flames are in-folded<br>
Into the crowned knot of fire<br>
And the fire and the rose are one.</p>
