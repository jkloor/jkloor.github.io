<p align="left">When Mae Holland is hired to work for the Circle, the world&rsquo;s most   powerful internet company, she feels she&rsquo;s been given the opportunity of   a lifetime. The Circle, run out of a sprawling California campus, links   users&rsquo; personal emails, social media, banking, and purchasing with   their universal operating system, resulting in one online identity and a   new age of civility and transparency. As Mae tours the open-plan office   spaces, the towering glass dining facilities, the cozy dorms for those   who spend nights at work, she is thrilled with the company&rsquo;s modernity   and activity. There are parties that last through the night, there are   famous musicians playing on the lawn, there are athletic activities and   clubs and brunches, and even an aquarium of rare fish retrieved from the   Marianas Trench by the CEO. Mae can&rsquo;t believe her luck, her great   fortune to work for the most influential company in the worldâ€”even as   life beyond the campus grows distant, even as a strange encounter with a   colleague leaves her shaken, even as her role at the Circle becomes   increasingly public. What begins as the captivating story of one woman&rsquo;s   ambition and idealism soon becomes a heart-racing novel of suspense,   raising questions about memory, history, privacy, democracy, and the   limits of human knowledge.
