<p align="left">
Tristram Foxe and his wife, Beatrice-Joanna, live in their skyscraper world where official family limitation 
glorifies homosexuality. Eventually, their world is transformed into a chaos of cannibalistic dining-clubs, 
fantastic fertility rituals, and wars without anger. It is a novel both extravagantly funny and grimly serious. <br />
<br />
Quotes and thoughts while reading: <br />
<br />
I love it when a dystopian novel doesn't beat around the bush. See here, on page 5 "You've had your recommended ration.
No more motherhood for you. Try to stop feeling like a mother." (p 5) This is right after her son was let return to Mother
Earth, the added bonus that they got some phosphorous out of him. <br />
<br />
<em>"It's Sapiens to Homo"</em> (p 6) <br />
<br />
<u>atavistic:</u> relating to or characterized by reversion to something ancient or ancestral. <br />
<br />
'They're not supposed to understand it too well.' said Tristram. 'Just a general impression, you know. It's in the syllabus 
but never comes up in the exam.' (p 28) How many times can you remember experiencing this? <br />
<br />
"A dance-tune plopped out suddenly, as though a bag of ripe plums had burst" (p 40) See there are gems like this, festooned all
over the place, another was "lemon sunlight". Dog, I just love that line, "lemon sunlight". <br />
<br />
"Apparently they had a copy of the Bible - Dognose where they'd got it from." (p 43) I do appreciate the replacement of "God", 
with "Dog" everywhere, "For Dog-sake let's know where we stand" (p 62) <br />
<br />
<u>truculent:</u> eager or quick to argue or fight; aggressively defiant. <br />
<br />
<em>Hoc est enim Corpus. Hic est enim calix sanguinis.</em> &#10148 This is my body. This is the cup of blood. (p 169) Whew, I
really thought this was going to be something clever hidden in the Latin, but in actuality, it's just a common Christian saying, 
albeit, this all takes on a different light in this book. <br />
<br />
'And as far as possible,' said the television face of the Right Honourable George Ocham, Prime Minister, 'to pursue the good
life with a minimum of State interference.' It was the face of a business tycoon - fat-jowled with firm but self-indulgent lips,
hard-bargain-driving eyes..." (p 191) Man, doesn't that sound like Trump? <br />
<br />
eleemosynary: of, relating to, or dependent on charity; charitable <br />
<br />
"The small capitalists were crawling out of their holes, rats of the Pelphase but Augustine's lions." (p 193)<br />
<br />
"He has this precious career to think of, a man with children standing a better chance of promotion to Minister of Fertility
than a man with none, or so he says... Looking out to sea I now pray daily that the sea will send you back to me... I love
you and if I ever hurt you I am sorry." (p 223) Jesus, how things change, what a compete and total reversal, you've got to read 
the whole book to appreciate all this. <br />
<br />
"Then all the big noise ceased, nor were there any specifically human sounds, only animal gasps of those late in dying. One last
flash showed him his watch: 2203. Three minutes from start to finish." (p 260) The whole lead up to this fight was very compelling,
and confusing. I am still curious who he fought, it's claimed they looked different, but still. <br />
<br />
'What's an E.S.?' <br />
'Extermination Session. That's what the new battles are called, you know... They were well trained, and well armed and they died
 gloriously, believing they were dying in a great cause....' <br />
 'You just take advantage of the poor devils who don't know any better - is that it?' <br />
 'Of course. We're better off without the morons and the enthusiasts.' (p 277) <br />
 <br />
 'Despite its name,' [the major] said 'the War Department is not really a branch of the government at all. It's a corporation. The
term "War Department" is merely a link with the past. A corporation with a charter.' (p 278) And this, was one of my favorite bits,
because it is so absurd, but completely and totally probably. And I love it for that. <br />
<br />
Surprise, surprise, another gread read from the likes of GB and MN. Thanks you two.
