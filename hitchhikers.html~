<p> <sectionhead><em> The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy </em></sectionhead> </p>

<p align="left">
Seconds before Earth is demolished to make way for a galactic freeway, Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by
his friend Ford Prefect, a researcher for the revised edition of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy who, for
the last fifteen years, has been posing as an out-of-work actor. <br />
<br />
Together, this dynamic pair began a journey through space aided by a galaxyful of fellow travelers: 
Zaphod Beeblebrox, the two-headed, three-armed, ex-hippie and totally out-to-lunch president of the 
galaxy; Trillian (formerly Tricia McMillan), Zaphod’s girlfriend, whom Arthur tried to pick up at a c
ocktail party once upon a time zone; Marvin, a paranoid, brilliant, and chronically depressed robot; 
and Veet Voojagig, a former graduate student obsessed with the disappearance of all the ballpoint pens 
he’s bought over the years. <br />
<br />
Where are these pens? Why are we born? Why do we die? For all the answers, stick your thumb to the stars!
