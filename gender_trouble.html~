<p align="left">
One of the most talked-about scholarly works of the past fifty years, Judith Butlerâ€™s Gender Trouble is as celebrated as it is controversial.<br />
<br />
Arguing that traditional feminism is wrong to look to a natural, 'essential' notion of the female, or indeed of sex or gender, Butler starts by 
questioning the category 'woman' and continues in this vein with examinations of 'the masculine' and 'the feminine'. Best known however, but 
also most often misinterpreted, is Butler's concept of gender as a reiterated social performance rather than the expression of a prior reality. <br />
<br />
Thrilling and provocative, few other academic works have roused passions to the same extent. <br />

Quotes and thoughts while reading: <br />
<br />
"Foucoult points out that juridical systems of power produce the subjects they subsequently come to represent... the subjects regulated
by such structures, are by virtue of being subjected to them, formed, defined, and reproduced in accordance with the requirements of 
those structures..." (p 2) <br />
<br />
"If one "is" a woman, that is surely not all one is; the term fails to be exhaustive, not because a pregendered "person" transcends the 
specific paraphernalia of its gender, but because gender is not always constituted coherently or consistently in different historical
contexts, and because gender intersects with racial, class, ethnic, sexual, and regional modalities of discursively constituted identities.
As a result, it becomes impossible to separate out "gender" from the political and cultural intersections in which it is invariably produced
and maintained." (p 4) <br />
<br />
"Is the construction of the category of women as a coherent and stable subject an unwitting regulation and reification of gender relations?
And is not such a reification precisely contrary to feminist aims? To what extent does the category of women achieve stability and coherence
only in the context of the heterosexual matrix? If a stable notion of gender no longer proves to be the foundational premise of feminist
politics, perhaps a new sort of feminist politics is now desirable to contest the very reifications of gender and identity, one that will
take the variable construction of identity as both methodological and normative prerequisite, it not a political goal." (p 5) <br />
<br />
"When the constructed status of gender is theorized as radically independent of sex, gender itself becomes a free-floating artifice, with the
consequence that man and masculine might just as easily signify a  female body as a male one, and woman and feminine a male body as easily a
female one." (p 6) <br />
<br />
"Gender is the linguistic index of the political opposition between the sexes. Gender is used here in the singular because indeed there
are not two genders. There is only one: the feminine, the "masculine" not being a gender. For the masculine is not the masculine, but the
general." (p 20) <br />
<br />
"This text (Gender Trouble) continues, then, as an effort to think through the possibility of subverting and displacing those naturalized
and reified notions of gender that support masculine hegemony and heterosexist power, to make gender trouble, not through the
strategies that  figure a utopian beyond, but through the mobilization, subversive confusion, and proliferation of precisely those 
constitutive categories that seek to keep gender in its place by posturing as the foundational illusions of identity." (p 34) <br />
<br />
"As in the existential dialectic of misogyny, this is yet another instance in which reason and mind are associated with masculinity
and agency, while the body and nature are considered to be the mute facticity of the feminine, awaiting signification from an opposing
masculine subject." (p 37) <br />
<br />
"Published in 1929, Joan Riviere's essay, "Womanliness as a Masquerade" introduces the notion of femininity as masquerade in terms
of a theory of aggression and conflict revolution...." (p 50) Definitely look more into the essay. <br />
<br />
"Inasmuch as gender is the cultural transformation of a biological polysexuality into a culturally mandated heterosexuality and 
inasmuch as that heterosexuality deploys discrete and hierarchized gender identities to accomplish its aim, then the breakdown
of the compulsory character of heterosexuality would imply, for Rubin, the corollary breakdown of gender itself. Whether or not 
gender can be fully eradicated and in what sense its "breakdown" is culturally imaginable remain intriguing but unclarified 
implications of her analysis." (p 75) <br />
<br />
"By projecting the lesbian as "Other" to culture, and characterizing lesbian speech as psychotic "whirl-of-winds", Kristeva
constructs lesbian sexuality as intrinsically unintelligible." (p 87) <br />
<br />
<strong>"In opposition to this false construction of "sex" as both univocal and causal, Foucoult engages a reverse-discourse which treats
"sex" as an <em>effect</em> rather than an origin. In the place of "sex" as the original and continuous cause and signification
of bodily pleasures, he proposes "sexuality" as an open and complex historical system of discourse and power the produces the misnomer
"sex" as part of a strategy to conceal and, hence, to perpetuate power-relations." </strong> (p 95) <br />
<br />
Page 108 brings up the notion of naturally born XX-males and XY-females with seemingly correct appearing outside genitalia, but sterile
reproductive organs. What makes these person XX-males or XX-females? <br />
<br />
"Hence, for Wittig, we might say, one is not born female, one becomes female; but even more radically, one can, if once chooses, become
neither female not male, woman nor man." (p 113) <br />
<br />
"Consider that a sedimentation of gender norms produces the peculiar phenomenon of a "natural sex" or a "real woman" or any number
of prevalent and compelling social fictions, and that this is a sedimentation that over time has produced a set of corporeal styles
which, in reified form, appear as the natural configuration of bodies into sexes existing in a binary relation to one another. If
these styles are enacted, and if they produce the coherent gendered subjects who pose as their originators, what kind of performance
might reveal this ostensible "cause" to be an "effect"? (p 140) <br />
<br />
"There is no ontology of gender on which we might construct a politics, for gender ontologies always operate within established
political contexts as normative injunctions, determining what qualifies as intelligible sex, invoking and consolidating the
reproductive constraints on sexuality, setting the prescriptive requirements whereby sexed or gendered bodies come into cultural
intelligibility." (p 148)
