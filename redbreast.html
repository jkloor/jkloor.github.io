<p> <sectionhead><em> The Redbreast </em></sectionhead> </p>
<p align="left">Shifting effortlessly between the last days of WWII on the Eastern front and modern day Oslo, Norwegian Nesbø (<em>The Devil's Star</em>)   spins a complex tale of murder, revenge and betrayal. A recovering   alcoholic recently reassigned to the Norwegian Security Service, Insp.   Harry Hole begins tracking Sverre Olsen, a vicious neo-Nazi who escaped   prosecution on a technicality. But what starts as a quest to put Olsen   behind bars soon explodes into a race to prevent an assassination. As   Hole struggles to stay one step ahead of Olsen and his gang of   skinheads, Nesbø takes the reader back to WWII, as Norwegians fighting   for Hitler wage a losing battle on the Eastern front. When the two story   lines finally collide, it's up to Hole to stop a man hell-bent on   carrying out the deadly plan he hatched half a century ago in the   trenches. Perfectly paced and painfully suspenseful, this crime novel   illuminates not only Norway's alleged Nazi ties but also its present   skinhead subculture. Readers will delight in Hole, a laconic hero as   doggedly stubborn as Connelly's Harry Bosch, and yet with a prickly   appeal all his own. <em>(Dec.)</em> <br />
