<p> <sectionhead><em> Survival of the Nicest </em></sectionhead> </p>
<p align="left">This revelatory tour de force by an acclaimed and internationally   bestselling science writer upends our understanding of &ldquo;survival of the   fittest&rdquo;—and invites us all to think and act more altruistically<br />
  <br />
The phrase &ldquo;survival of the fittest&rdquo; conjures an image of the most   cutthroat individuals rising to the top. But Stefan Klein, author of the   #1 international bestseller <em>The Science of Happiness</em>, makes the   startling assertion that altruism is the key to lasting personal and   societal success. In fact, altruism defines us: Natural selection   favored those early humans who cooperated in groups, and with survival   more assured, our altruistic ancestors were free to devote brainpower to   developing intelligence, language, and culture—our very humanity.<br />
<br />
Klein&rsquo;s groundbreaking findings lead him to a vexing question: If we&rsquo;re   really hard-wired to act for one another&rsquo;s benefit, why aren&rsquo;t we all   getting along? He believes we&rsquo;ve learned to mistrust our instincts   because success is so often attributed to selfish ambition, and with an   extraordinary array of material—current research on genetics and the   brain, economics, social psychology, behavioral and anthropological   experiments, history, and modern culture—he makes the case that   generosity for its own sake remains the best way to thrive.</p>
