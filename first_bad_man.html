<p> <sectionhead><em> The First Bad Man </em></sectionhead> </p>

<p align="left">
From the acclaimed filmmaker, artist, and bestselling author of No One Belongs Here More Than You, 
a spectacular debut novel that is so heartbreaking, so dirty, so tender, so funny—so Miranda July—
that readers will be blown away. <br />
<br />
Here is Cheryl, a tightly-wound, vulnerable woman who lives alone, with a perpetual lump in her throat. 
She is haunted by a baby boy she met when she was six, who sometimes recurs as other people’s babies. 
Cheryl is also obsessed with Phillip, a philandering board member at the women’s self-defense nonprofit 
where she works. She believes they’ve been making love for many lifetimes, though they have yet to 
consummate in this one. <br />
<br />
When Cheryl’s bosses ask if their twenty-one-year-old daughter, Clee, can move into her house for a little
 while, Cheryl’s eccentrically ordered world explodes. And yet it is Clee—the selfish, cruel blond bombshell
 —who bullies Cheryl into reality and, unexpectedly, provides her the love of a lifetime. <br />
 <br />
Tender, gripping, slyly hilarious, infused with raging sexual obsession and fierce maternal love, Miranda 
July’s first novel confirms her as a spectacularly original, iconic, and important voice today, and a writer 
for all time. The First Bad Man is dazzling, disorienting, and unforgettable.
