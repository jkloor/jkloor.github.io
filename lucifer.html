<p align="left">
With both passion and precision, Lucifer at the Starlite explores life’s dual nature: good and evil, 
light and dark, suffering and moments of unexpected joy. Whether looking outward to events on the world 
stage—the war in Iraq, the 2004 Asian tsunami—or inward at struggles with the self, these poems aim at 
the heart and against the feeling that Lucifer may have already won the day. <br />

Notes and thoughts while reading: <br />
<br />
This is a book of poetry to keep on you at all times. Simply open it to a random page, and a poem will greet
you where ever you are. These are poems from the dark places, and the not so dark places we have all lived through. There
are lines that will bring smiles, and lines that will droop them. But I think that they are great to just have
around you.
